# üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

This project utilizes the following technologies and tools:

- **HTML/CSS**  
  For structuring and styling the frontend user interface.

- **JavaScript (Frontend-only)**  
  Handles fetching data from the CheapShark API and dynamically updating the UI.

- **Docker**  
  Containerizes the frontend app and other components for consistent deployment environments.

- **Docker Compose**  
  Manages multi-container setups including frontend instances and the HAProxy load balancer.

- **HAProxy**  
  Provides load balancing across multiple frontend containers, improving reliability and scalability.

- **Curl**  
  Used for testing HTTP endpoints both inside containers and from the host machine.

- **CheapShark API**  
  External API providing real-time game deal data, including prices, discounts, and store information.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges and How They Were Overcome

- **Docker Configuration:**  
  Ensuring proper installation, assigning of ports, and configuring Docker and Docker Compose correctly to run multiple containers with proper networking.

- **Network Errors Debugging:**  
  Encountered errors like "connection reset by peer" when accessing the load balancer from the local machine. Debugged by verifying container networking, port exposure, and load balancer HAProxy configuration.

- **Load Balancer Setup:**  
  Configured HAProxy with backend servers correctly, tested load balancing inside the container. While requests worked inside the container, there was an unresolved issue with curl requests failing from the host machine.

- **Port Conflicts:**  
  Ensured ports used in Docker Compose were free on the host machine before binding to avoid conflicts.
